Data Analysis of Heart Attack Data, in R
# Heart Data Analysis in R

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about various attributes related to heart health. The goal is to perform data analysis using R.

### Attributes
- `age`: Age of the individual
- `sex`: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type (0, 1, 2, 3)
- `trtbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2)
- `thalachh`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exng`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- `slp`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0, 1, 2)
- `caa`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
- `thall`: Thalassemia type (0, 1, 2, 3)
- `output`: Heart disease diagnosis (1 = presence, 0 = absence)

## Getting Started
1. Install R on your machine: [R Installation](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. Install RStudio for a more user-friendly interface: [RStudio Installation](https://rstudio.com/)
3. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

## Running the Analysis
1. Open the R script provided in this repository using RStudio.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary R packages installed.
    ```R
    install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "corrplot"))
    ```
3. Execute the script to perform the data analysis.

## Analysis Results
The analysis will include exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and visualization of key features. The goal is to understand the relationships between different attributes and the likelihood of heart disease.

Feel free to customize the analysis based on your specific research questions and objectives.
